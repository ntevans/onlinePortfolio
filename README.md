# HTML Portfolio
My personal portfolio that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website exists to house some of the projects I've been working on as well as to showcase my technical skill as well as my creative side.

## What I've learned
Most of the HTML and CSS that I learned was through my first portfolio that I designed in class for a competition at Texas A&M. This website, however, really refined my skills as, now that I have the basics down, I can focus more on making my website look even better, and my code even cleaner. Especially now that I don't have the restrictions that I did in my class, I have full creative control.

While working on this project, I came across a fork in the road and couldn't decide for a while what was the best route. On one hand, I could work using bootstrap or continue to use just straight css. The biggest deciding facor for me was that I personally like having full control over the look. Unfortunately, at this state, that means that my code will be a little messy, so I need to continue to learn the best way to manage my code, but for a personal website, this is perfectly fine for now.
