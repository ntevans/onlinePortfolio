# HTML Portfolio
My personal portfolio that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website exists to house some of the projects I've been working on as well as to showcase my technical skill as well as my creative side.

## What I've learned
Most of the HTML and CSS that I learned was through my first portfolio that I designed in class for a competition at Texas A&M. This website, however, really refined my skills as, now that I have the basics down, I can focus more on making my website look even better, and my code even cleaner. Especially now that I don't have the restrictions that I did in my class, I have full creative control.
